# ðŸ§² Transmission Renamer
Bulk torrent file renamer using Transmission's RPC protocol. Upon completion of this project its aim is to make renaming large amounts of torrent files faster and easier, using a variety of custom rules which are applied to the selected torrent files.

Currently this project is **unfinished**, not all core functionality has been implemented and there are still a large amount of bugs to fix.
An overview of implemented and planned functionality can be found below, as well as some screenshots showcasing the user interface.


#### Note
When (eventually) all functionalities and rules are implemented in this project I may start doing a .NET Core rewrite of this application with the aim of providing cross-platform support and improved code overall. Very little planning was done for this particular project, but should I one day start with the full rewrite preparations will be made where they are most important.
